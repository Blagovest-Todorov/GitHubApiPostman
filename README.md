What is Postman?

Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster.
Tools

The Postman platform includes a comprehensive set of tools that help accelerate the API lifecycle—from design, testing, documentation, and mocking to the sharing and discoverability of your APIs.
API client

The Postman API client is the foundational tool of Postman, and it enables you to easily explore, debug, and test your APIs while also enabling you to define complex API requests for HTTP, REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and WebSockets.

The API client automatically detects the language of the response, links, and format text inside the body to make inspection easy. The client also includes built-in support for authentication protocols like OAuth 1.2/2.0, AWS Signature, Hawk, and many more.

Through the API client, you can organize requests into Postman Collections to help you organize your requests for reuse so you don't waste time building everything from scratch. Your collections can also contain JavaScript code to tie requests together or automate common workflows, and you can use scripting to visualize your API responses as charts and graphs.
